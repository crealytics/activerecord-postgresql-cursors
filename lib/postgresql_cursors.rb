# Add cursor support for PostgreSQL to ActiveRecord.
#
# This extension allows you to loop through record sets using cursors in an
# Enumerable fashion. This allows you to cut down memory usage by only pulling
# in individual records on each loop rather than pulling everything into
# memory all at once.
#
# To use a cursor, just change the first parameter to an
# ActiveRecord::Base#find to :cursor instead of :first or :all.
#
#	MyModel.find(:cursor, :conditions => 'some_column = true').each do |r|
#		puts r.inspect
#	end
#
#	MyModel.find(:cursor).collect { |r| r.foo / PI }.avg
#
# All ActiveRecord::Base#find options are available and should work as-is.
# Available enumerable methods are:
#
# * each
# * each_with_index
# * collect/map
#
# When you use a cursor, you're going to get back a PostgreSQLCursor object
# which provides the actual enumerable methods. At the moment, this is a
# non-scrollable cursor -- it will only fetch forward. Also note that these
# cursors are non-updateable/insensitive to updates to the underlying data.
#
# The cursor itself is wrapped in a transaction as is required by PostgreSQL
# and the cursor name is automatically generated using random numbers. On
# raised SQL exceptions, the transaction is ABORTed and the cursor CLOSEd.
#
# Associations are handled, so you can use :include in your find options. Of
# course, this requires some nonsense when moving the cursor around, but it
# works all the same.
